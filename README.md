# Time Complexity Experiment

Simple iteration-based experiment to determine whether it is faster in python to add an item to a sorted list whilst keeping it sorted, then find an item using binary search, or to add an item to an unsorted list and then find an item using linear search

This is the results of the experiment aswell as the code

NOTE - main.py erases the contents of the results.txt file when run
